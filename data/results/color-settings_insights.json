in the print industry the pantone system is the standard language for color communication from designer to manufacturer to default store to customer the pantone system is now largely accepted and relied upon by printers, manufacturers, marketers, artists, designers, and others there are 1,114 colors, each assigned with a number and name by using the pantone system, people in different locations can refer to the same color by knowing only the number that identifies it this helps manufacturers and others to avoid mistakes like color deviation between the design and the finished product add a pantone color by default, we have added 900+ pantone colors in our system also, admin gets the option to add their own pantone color to add the same, click on the pantone color setting

added colors will be displayed as per the upload type selected rgb cmyk mapping many graphics software programs give you the choice to work in either rgb or cmyk these are called \"color spaces\" scanners and digital cameras create images using combinations of just three colors red, green, and blue (called \"rgb\") these are the primary colors of light, which computers use to display images on your screen printing presses print full color pictures using a different set of colors, the primary colors of pigment cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow and black (called \"cmyk\") this is \"4 color process\" or \"full color\" printing that comprises the majority of magazines and marketing materials you see every day when creating a map that will be displayed on a computer monitor the rgb color model is generally better to use when creating a printed map it is generally better to use the cmyk color model one problem that printers deal with is the conversion between the rgb images displayed on their screen and the outputted cmyk images being printed out for such mapping we have provided this rgb cmyk mapping section where you can define the rgb value and associate a cmyk color value with it as per your printer\u2019s specification\nDid this page help you?\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nStudio Language Text References\nNEXT\nCustom CSS Settings\n\n\n"
