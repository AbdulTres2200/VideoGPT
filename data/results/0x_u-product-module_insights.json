personalization enhancement mass template personalization enhancement we had the feature to allow your customers to personalize the templates in bulk using the upload xls file feature this worked great with large scale products but for smaller scale products such as product labels and stickers, it was quite tedious so, considering the small scale products, we have enhanced the mass template personalization feature in version 10 1 admin configuration for this, we modified the \"mass personalization\" setting in the product settings, where the admin will specify which options they wish to provide to customers\u2014only xls upload, only form fill, or both if the admin has selected both in the above setting, then they can also define which option among the two will appear as default selected for the customers in addition, the admin can also define if they want to allow customers to personalize the images from the templates front store options after the configuration, when the customers opt to mass template personalize they will have the options based on your settings here, as an example, we have configured \"both\" for personalization and kept \"upload excel file\" as a default so, at the front end, the customers will have both the options to personalize and upload excel file option by default selected the customers can select to either enter the data using an xls file or enter the data manually when adding the data manually, the customers have the option to add more data using the \" add more \" button after adding the data, your customers can check the
