systematic guideline to setup epms in your onprintshop web store 1 create an epms account 1 create an epms account visit the epms site and create a new account 2 configuration in admin panel 2 configuration in admin panel on your admin panel, go to the store configurations >> external service settings >> accounting tab >> epms >> \u2018\u2018edit\u2019 option enter the epms username and password url the url you will receive from the epms side order no all the orders post the order number entered here, will be synced between the platforms for example, if you have entered 100 here then, all the orders after order number 100 will be synced customer account the name entered here will be considered for assigning new customers to this account restrict fingoodcode if you want to restrict the fingoodcode within the order product then you can enable this setting job description if you want to add some description with the order job, then you mention that here when this space is left blank, then the system will take the default job description set (onprintshop order #ordernumber) sync po number enable this setting, if you want to sync the order po number between the platforms refer from in this setting, you need to select the location from which the userdefined fields (extra fields) will be considered i e from the mapping section or the option when you select to refer to the fields from the option, you need to have product options created in the onprintshop system from the admin panel >> products >> product options screen, click on the add button for the options created in the epms, you need to create the same option here with an internal title for reference to map the options, you have to enter the option key as \"e rush\" similar to the option key, the attribute key will have \"e rush\" as a prefix and the attribute value after that for the sync once synced, the data will be shared within the component tag of the xml schema \\<component> \\<rush>2\\</rush> here, there will be the open and close tags for the option with the attribute selected in the order product along with this, you can also push post press process information by entering the details such as process code, and repetitions in the product information field of the product settings section customer billing info if you want to sync the customer's billing information into epms order fields, then enable this setting sync order status select the order statuses for which you want to enable the automatic synchronization from onprintshop to epms kindly note that this setting is applicable only when the auto synchronization mode is on update order status select the order statuses for which you would like to allow the status updates from epms to onprintshop stock management enable this option to manage epms stock once enable it and click on the save button, the material code mapping button will appear under the sync summary section log/stock status update info enable this setting, if you want to log the details of stock sync and order status updates 3 order level field mapping 3 order level field mapping now, let's move forward and map the onprintshop fields with the epms tags create extra fields/store fields for default store customer, create extra fields from the admin panel >> customers >> website customers >> extra fields >> create for the store customer, create store fields from the admin panel >> store management >> store profile >> add for example, if you want to map \"custaccount\" to the extra field or in the store profile then enter the field name as \" custaccount \" the field name should match the epms tags note make sure the \"field name\" in extra field or store profile is the same as the epms tags map fields to map the fields, go to the admin panel >> store configurations >> external service settings >> epms >> \u2018action\u2019 dropdown >> \u2018edit\u2019 option map the created field with epms tags 4 product level default values 4 product level default values you can also define product specific field\u2019s default values in epms for this, go to the admin panel >> store configurations >> external service settings >> epms >> \u2018action\u2019 dropdown >> \u2018edit\u2019 option >> sync summary >> product mapping >> select user type and specific product 5 material code mapping 5 material code mapping for mapping, the \"material code\" generated on the epms side will be used to establish a connection between onprintshop and epms the material code can be defined based on the product sizes and the sizes can be managed from the 'edit designer option' action in the product listing for the automatic order status update and stock update, the automation setup should be enabled from the technical side to enable the automation, kindly contact onprintshop technical support to add the material code, click on the material code mapping button under the sync summary section clicking on the material code mapping button will redirect you to the manage material coding page to add a material code, choose the product from the select option for which a material code needs to be added ( note only products with enabled stock will be listed in the product select option ) after selecting the product, the table below will list all the sizes associated with the selected product enter the material code in the input field corresponding to the size, and click the save button to save the material code for that particular size to the selected product if you want to add material code for the size with product option combination instead of just the product size, you just need to enable the \"refer from sku\" setting and the system will consider the sku mentioned under the products sku section when enabling the refer from sku option, ensure that the details are saved after saving, the system will delete all the existing material codes for the selected product additionally, ensure that the stock is added according to the configuration you are using (e g , only size, refer from sku) admin can also delete the material code for a specific product from the delete action button (i e will delete all the material code associated with that product ) this material code will be utilized as a mapping reference between epms and onprintshop for updating stock in onprintshop using material code utilize the api \" getinventorystatus \" to retrieve the stock information for a specific product size using its mapped material code iterate through each material code to retrieve its stock information from the api response upon obtaining the stock details, update the stock information in the onprintshop to reflect the current stock accurately for updating order status in onprintshop utilize the api \" getsummaryjobstatus \" to retrieve the epms job status of the sent job number fetch all orders except those marked as complete from the onprintshop validate the status of each retrieved order in the epms, cross referencing with onprintshop data update the order status in the onprintshop with the current status fetched from the epms, maintaining consistency across systems note we will only update the order status in onprintshop if the current onprintshop order status differs from the epms order status if they are the same, no update will be made in onprintshop for updating tracking numberin ops utilize the api \" getjobshippingstatus \" to retrieve the tracking number information send an epms job number in the request and receive the tracking number in response the response will include shipment/package details; extract the tracking number from the first package update the tracking number in onprintshop for the order associated with the sent job number the tracking number will be updated alongside the order status in onprintshop it will only be updated if received from epms note the tracking number will be updated alongside the order status in onprintshop it will only be updated if received from epms 6 6 create a remote folder for all files create a remote folder for all files before we sync the orders, the system needs a folder location where the order's print ready files can be transferred for this, you need to configure an ftp folder location from the ops admin panel >> order >> export/api orders >> export/api settings >> hot folder settings tab once you have entered all the details, you can test the connection using the test connection button 7 7 get order sync and log report get order sync and log report you can manually
