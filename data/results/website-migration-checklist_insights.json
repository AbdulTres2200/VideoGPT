when the same content is accessed by different urls old url redirection to the new urls every old url that does not exists redirects to a url that is available in the new website structure create a good equivalent of each old url so that every old url could redirect to a new page very similar to the old page if there is no equivalent url set the redirection to the new url that best matches the old content no backlinks point to error pages after your relaunch to preserve your seo performance pay special attention to the urls that have backlinks from other domains compile a full list of all backlinks set up a redirection to a good destination if no url is found for redirection create a new page that satisfies the need for old content use 301 status codes for permanent redirects it is a strong recommendation to use 301 status codes for permanent redirects indexing and crawling of new links indexing and crawling of new links check for robots txt files that could prevent your website content from being crawled and indexed by search engine bots after launching the website make sure no command from the robot txt file prevents your website from being crawled to exclude certain pages from being indexed using \u201cnoindex\u201d meta tags check for missing internal links make sure that the pages driving traffic lose a big number of internal links after the relaunch losing internal links can create a loss in organic traffic as they are an important contributor to overall seo performance other technical look about other technical look about check for canonical implementation as per the old website if your website has canonical tag implementations, then make sure that it is not lost on the new website canonical tags can be useful for signaling to search engines which version of a page should be indexed don\u2019t let your website generate duplicate urls, but sometimes the implementation of canonical tags is feasible pay attention to the 301 redirects to set for canonical and non canonical urls all 301 redirects for urls from your old website should point to canonical urls on your new website check for website xml sitemap as it makes it easier for search engine robots

ranking for domain switch for domain switch set up and verify the webmaster tools (google / bing / yandex) when you change domains, set up, and verify the webmaster tools this might take a few days until your property shows data and you start monitoring errors and developments after the website relaunch inform the webmasters' tools inform webmasters of a domain switch search engines allow you to inform them about the domain change via webmaster tools this will speed up the process of replacing all urls from the old domain with urls from the new domain in the search engine indexes check for the old ssl certificate after you set up redirects from your old domain to your new domain, the redirects will only work as long as the old domain is still registered under your ownership also, if you had http urls on your old website, you need to have a valid ssl certificate other requirements other requirements create a user friendly error 404 pages the 404 pages should be implemented correctly from a technical perspective relaunching can lead to a bigger number of 404 errors, thus make sure to create a user friendly 404 page for your website from the technical perspective look for the following implementations \u2013 do not redirect faulty urls to a 404 page all 404 pages should return a 404 status code set up a report for tracking 404 errors in google analytics check page load speed metrics for the better user experience and seo success, it is very important to check the page speed top ranking in organic search and page speed metrics go hand in hand, and if do manage your website to rank with slow pages a very few visitors will have the patience to wait until the page loads check the page speed metrics of your website before the relaunch make page speed your top priority nobody accepts an excuse for having a slow website not neglect the mobile version of your new website in the mobile world, it will be foolish if you ignore the mobile versions of your website audit your new website to make sure it is crawlable in the mobile versions of search engine crawlers \u201cmobile first indexing\u201d is yet another reason why you should not neglect mobile crawling before relaunching your new website post launch requirements post launch requirements no pages to be crawled are blocked by robot txt check if the pages you want to crawl are not blocked by the robot txt file check the resources needed for complete rendering of your websites, such as css or js file, make sure they are not blocked by the robot txt file use the crawl error reports to keep track of

problems monitor these numbers as a significant change is often caused by internal factors instead of external ones crawl the old urls to make sure the redirection is working correctly after your new website goes live, it is advisable to crawl all the old urls and check if all the redirections are working exactly as they are supposed to be every old url should continue returning a working page
