to the studio setting screen in studio settings, we created a new tab from which the admin can set the preview image dpi based on sizes for example, for products maximum up to 10 in size, the dpi will be 100 and the preview will be generated with a minimum 200 pixel dimension and a maximum 400 pixel in dimension so, this setting will apply to all the products whose sizes fall in the configured
