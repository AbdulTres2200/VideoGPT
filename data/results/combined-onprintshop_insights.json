using the upload xls file feature this worked great with large scale products but for smaller scale products such as product labels and stickers, it was quite tedious so, considering the small scale products, we have enhanced the mass template personalization feature in version 10 1 admin configuration for this, we modified the \"mass personalization\" setting in the product settings, where the admin will specify which options they wish to provide to customers\u2014only xls upload, only form fill, or both if the admin has selected both in the above setting, then they can also define which option among the two will appear as default selected for the customers in addition, the admin can also define if they want to allow customers to personalize the images from the templates front store options after the configuration, when the customers opt to mass template personalize they will have the options based on your settings here, as an example, we have configured \"both\" for

together (as shown above in the example) under the \u2018 canvas\u2019 tab, you can see a list of additional options created for the canvas product as per the general specification of canvas product,

largely accepted and relied upon by printers, manufacturers, marketers, artists, designers, and others there are 1,114 colors, each assigned with a number and name by using the pantone system, people in different locations can refer to the same color by knowing only the number that identifies it this helps manufacturers and others to avoid mistakes like color deviation between the design and the

scanners and digital cameras create images using combinations of just three colors red, green, and blue (called \"rgb\") these are the primary colors of light, which computers use to display images on your screen printing presses print full color pictures using a different set of colors, the primary colors of pigment cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow and black (called \"cmyk\") this is \"4 color process\" or \"full color\" printing that comprises the majority of magazines and marketing materials you see every day when creating a map that will be displayed on a computer monitor the rgb color model is generally better to use when creating a printed map it is generally better to use the cmyk color model one problem that printers deal with is the conversion between the rgb images displayed on their screen and the outputted cmyk images being printed out for such mapping we have provided this rgb cmyk mapping section where you can define the rgb value and associate a cmyk color value with

Calculation\n\n13 min\noverview the estimated delivery days are when a customer should receive their order at onprintshop, the estimated delivery days are based on the combination of the production (printing) time, the shipping days (the transit time), and the order date (the set cut off time) estimated delivery days = production days + delivery days + weekend days + order cut off time the following article explains how the onprintshop system calculates the estimated delivery days \u2013 setup shipping days for shipping days set up, go to admin >> store configuration >> shipping method for each shipping method, under the action menu, you\u2019ll find an option named \u2018markup/delivery days\u2019 select the option to set the approximate delivery days enter the particular delivery days for each shipping type available in the shipping service provider production days (product preparation days) you can set product production days for the individual product (in the product edit section in each product and production days\u2019 section) note if your product takes 12 hours to make you have to enter 1 day these product preparation days are added to the shipping days given by your shipping company to give estimated delivery days production days for an individual product to add production days for individual products, go to admin >> products >> select any product >> \u2018action\u2019 menu >> \u2018edit\u2019 option >> configuration section similarly, you can define the production of all products (standard, custom, photobook, calendar, promotional, canvas, etc ) note the production days entered here will apply to the whole product irrespective of the product options production days for the individual product with additional option combination you can set different production days for each of the additional options of the product from admin >> products >> product weight/days >> \u2018production days\u2019 tab if you are setting preparation days on each additional option then the system won\u2019t show the estimated delivery days on the product info page, it will only show the delivery days once the user comes to the cart page if you have a large number of products and their additional options (variants) and you want to update the product production time using csv import then you can do that using the import feature available learn more about the product weight/days/sku docid 18jhomcwiss5dkbghqsm0 note the production days mentioned for additional options will be summed up with the production days specified in the product configuration (see example 2) production days and shipping days settings weekdays on which you have a holiday if your production house or your shipping company doesn\u2019t work on weekends or certain days, you can set weekends from this setting these days will not be counted in calculating the estimated delivery days you can select other days as well, say your company is not working on monday then you can enter this as well select default production days for all products \u2013 it is the default production days that will be summed up with production days of individual product with additional option combination or production days for individual product (whichever is defined) to determine the delivery days if production days are not defined for the product(s) then the days entered here are by default taken into consideration note you can even set common default production days for all your products rather than entering production days for individual products select default delivery days for the site \u2013 itto is the default shipping days that will be summed up with the shipping days defined for each in the shipping type if delivery days are not defined for each delivery method then the days entered here are by default taken into consideration order cut off time say, you start production every day and your last production time is 10 am after this, you don\u2019t start the production of new orders, you shift them to the next day\u2019s production slot using this setting you can set the cut off time say it is 10 am for your website, so when a customer comes to your website before 10 am they will see the estimated delivery days as counted from today and when a customer comes to the site after 10 am they will see the estimated days count from tomorrow example \u2013 1 we have added two products to the cart \u2013 each of the products has different production dates specified in the product configuration option the order date is 18th december 2019 standard business card \u2013 production days is 3 letterhead \u2013 production days is 1 the delivery day(s) is set as 1 and the weekend days are defined as \u2018saturday and sunday\u2019 thus, the system will consider the maximum production days among all the products added to the cart, thus the estimated delivery days are given below \u2013 estimated delivery days = (production days of a standard business card) + default delivery days (set in store configuration) + weekend days (saturday and sunday) + order cut off time (as the order is placed after 10 am) estimated delivery days = 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 which means the delivery will be on 25th december 2019 example \u2013 2 we have added two products to the cart \u2013 each of the products has different production dates specified in the product configuration option the order date is 18th december 2019 standard business card \u2013 production days is 3 we have set the production days for 2x3 5 size, square corner, 310 gsm paper, and matte finishing as \u2013 4 letterhead \u2013 production days is 1 no production days are set for additional options the delivery day(s) set are 1 and the weekend days are defines as \u2018saturday and sunday\u2019 (as in example 1) thus, the system will consider maximum production days among all the products added in the cart, thus the estimated delivery days are given as below \u2013 estimated delivery days = (production days of the standard business card plus production days with additional options) + default delivery days (set in store configuration) + weekend days (saturday and sunday) + order cut off times (as the order is placed after 10 am) estimated delivery days = 3 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 13 which means the delivery will be on 31st december 2019\nDid this page help

advantage is that in the common product option, you can configure all the possible attributes at once, and then, while assigning them to products, enable only the applicable attributes you can configure product option pricing based on formulas, multipliers, linear formula, or no price at all also, it can configure range lookup based on quantity, area, total area, number of sheets, etc configuration add product options you can create a new product option from the admin >> product >> product options >> add button here, you need to fill out data for the product option, such as type, weight sets, pricing method, presentation settings, add attributes, and description the description mentioned here will be the same for all the products to whom the option will be assigned title and tags the first element is the option title and tags set a suitable title for a product option second, assign suitable tags to the options this will help in categorizing similar product options based on specific criteria e g product type wise you can anytime click on the plus icon to add a new tag to add a tag, click the add button, enter the tag name, and save option details just like the product specific additional options, you get to define various settings for the product options type choose the input type for product option \u2013 there are various input types available namely radio button, dropdown, checkbox, textbox, additional information textbox, textarea, admin only, upload file, upload cloud file, upload multiple files and date picker weight setting here, define how the product option weight will be calculated multiply with quantity the weight will be multiplied by quantity for example, if the weight entered for attribute 1 is 0 1 and the quantity is 100 the weight will be calculated as \u2013 0 1 x 100 multiple with quantity and area \u2013 the weight will be multiplied by product quantity and product area for example \u2013 if the weight entered for attribute 1 is 0 1 then the customer orders 100 product quantities with size 3 x 2 5 i e area = 7 5 now, weight = 0 1 x 100 x 7 5 product specific weight \u2013 weight will be product specific multiply with sheet \u2013 the weight will be multiplied by several sheets for products with no sheet calculation, weight will be multiplied by quantity formula based custom weight calculation formulas can be defined for product options, ensuring accurate shipping charges and cost estimations for variable sized or custom products option key this will be a unique identifier for the product options this will come in handy while assigning the options to product(s) export order group the group data will be used in order export options add product option group from \u2013 admin >> product >> product option

you can anytime add a custom formula, just click on the plus icon and enter the label name for the formula, and then add the formula now, this newly added formula will be available every time you set an option based formula range lookup \u2013 when you set the custom formula, you can define how the product option price calculation lookup should be done depending upon the lookup selected you can create ranges (explained later in the document) the lookup can be done based on the quantity, area, sheet, height and width or page number of the product linear formula \u2013 the product price for each quantity within a range varies, the price for each quantity will increase in arithmetic progression this will calculate the value of intermediate points between two known values using a formula thus, allowing you to charge customers the same price for each unit (quantity) 3\\ multiplier in subtotal \u2013 the multiplier value of a specific attribute will be multiplied with the product sub total to get the price at once only a single option multiplier will be applied to the price for example, consider a situation where the multiplier is set in the following manner and these options are assigned to a product\u2013 product subtotal $1500 if the customer selects sample option 1 attribute 1 then the price will be $1500 x 1 5 = 2250 if the customer selects sample option 2 attribute 4 then the price will be $1500 x 1 4 = 2100 if the customer selects sample option 1 attribute 2 and sample option 2 \u2013 attribute 3 then the total price will be $1500 x 2 = 3000 this means that the system will calculate the price of the option whose sort order is found first if the pricing method is \"multiplier in subtotal\" 4\\ multiplier in the base price \u2013 the multiplier value of attributes will be multiplied by the product\u2019s base price to get the final price you\u2019ll get to set a multiplier for each product options attribute while adding attributes for example, consider a situation where the multiplier is set in the following manner, and these options are assigned to a product\u2013 product base price $5 if the customer selects sample option 1 attribute 2 and sample option 2 \u2013attribute 3 then the option price will be calculated as $5x 2 + $5 x 1 2 = $17 5 here, the system will calculate the price of all the options if the pricing method is \"multiplier in base price\" multiple with custom textbox this will list all the product options created as type \u2013 textbox choose the option(s) to multiply with the price of attributes how to add prices for product options with price setting \u2013 formula based? if the price setting is \u2013 formula based , then you\u2019ll be able to add attribute prices for this, click on the $ like symbol

can be applied to the b2b stores with this system, the order will be channeled to a company approver orders can be approved or rejected by the approver and the approver has some functionality to alter the order, if necessary note the order approval system will only work when pay on balance is enabled for the store types of approval systems there are three types of approval systems at onprintshop external approver (user designated approver) this relatively simple approval process enables the store customers ordering to provide the email address of the person who should approve their order the email address field appears at the shopping cart page level approvers in multi level approval process order will pass through multiple approvers and finally get approved here, the order will be approved by level 1 authority first then it will be carried forward to next level \u2013 level 2 after it gets approved from here it will be sent to next level, the cycle will follow until the order is approved by all the levels set by store (defined via site variable) two stage approval (main super approver followed by partial approver) the two stage approval process is used when partial approvers need to approve the order and then it flows to super approver office for the final approval this provides great functionality for large store and public sector clients who need advanced expenditure control however, if super approver approves the order while other partial approvers are remaining, the order gets automatically approved note all the approvers are dependent on each other, if there are multiple approvers for any order however, the super approver acts as an independent approver, meaning the orders approved by the super approver are directly marked as approved completely approval settings in our system this approval hierarchy is totally optional and flexible depending on the store structure, admin can decide upon the approval hierarchy and provide other order approval features there are a few related settings related to the same, such as \u2013 order approval no \u2013 the order will not undergo the approval process there will be no approver in the system yes \u2013 there will be an approval process in the system, where the admin and store admin will get the opportunity to define access roles for various store customers partial order \u2013 there will be an approval process, where the super admin will have the rights to approve order partially and delete product(s) from the order external approval no \u2013 there will be no provision for the store customer to enter the email id of any external approver optional \u2013 there will be a textbox given at the shopping cart page where the store customer can enter the email id of their external approvers however, filling the textbox will be optional mandatory \u2013 this will make the email textbox field mandatory for the store customers to fill allow user to cancel the order if you will enable this setting, then system will display cancel order button which allows the store customers to cancel their order which are pending for approval access roles this is the section where admin/ store admin will assign various access roles to their store customers different types of access roles that you can define are \u2013 allow access this is basic access required for a store customer to visit the storefront view orders/reports if this access right is enabled, store customer will be able to view the orders and reports allow checkout store customers having \u2018allow checkout\u2019 access rights will be able to place an order in case of default department, store customer by default gets access to place orders however, based on the change of 'view orders/reports' access, they may or may not be allowed to access the checkout page order approval permission if this access right is enabled, then the store customer can approve/reject the order of their subordinates none restricted approval rights super approval the super approver holds the maximum right in the store approval system an order marked as approved by any super approver will act as final approval, even though other users associated might be remaining to approve the order partial approval approval rights are applied partially there are chances that another person also needs to approve for those orders to get approved completely level approval the hierarchy of level approval process goes in a sequential manner i e level 1 > level 2 > level 3 > level 4 > level 5 and so on, as determined by the admin order modify permission this permission is only available for the supper approver this allows them to modify the order (update ordered product quantity and additional options) and even delete a few products allow inventory this option will be available only if the view reports / orders option is enabled store customers having this access can place or restrict inventory requests for the placed orders thus, allowing them to manage and store finished goods until the time of delivery case 1 \u2013 if department is disabled if department is disabled, then a customer will get access into the whole store one can allow the customer to view orders and reports grant then an order approval permission if a customer is super approver, give them the permission to modify the ordered products allow them to request inventory case 2 \u2013 if department is enabled and customer doesn\u2019t belong to a department a store customer's access rights and order checkout rights for departments can be restricted completely as shown below (with disabled 'allow access' toggle) site admin and store admin can enable the \u2018allow access\u2019 toggle and give the customer access to different departments if a customer is granted access in one or more departments, then, while login they\u2019ll get a dropdown, enlisting all the departments assigned to them here, they can select the department they are looking to log in \u2013 case 3 \u2013 if department is enabled and customer belongs to a department if the department is enabled, then initially the customer will have access to its own department later, one can choose to allow them access to other departments if a customer gets access to multiple departments, then a dropdown appears at the front end when the store customer intends to login here, the customer can choose to log in to its \u2018my account\u2019 or to any other department if a customer is chosen to be the super approver of a department then, any order placed in the department would require their final approval however, the orders placed by other departments\u2019 (printing, packaging, proofing) customers will not be displayed for the approver to this customer also, if the customer belonging to a particular department gets access to other departments and is assigned some approval roles, then they\u2019ll be able to place orders on behalf of those departments and even approve the orders coming from them order approval process the order process works in a very systematic way according to the business model any store can assign different approval roles to various customers refer to this schematic diagram to understand the order approval process scenario 1 (a simple system with super and partial approvers) consider a store with following settings \u2013 pay on account \u2013 enabled order approval \u2013 partial order external approval \u2013 optional there are total 4 store customers, out of which there is one super approver and two partial approvers the order approval process in this scenario goes as follows \u2013 when a customer (with no access roles) places an order, he mentions an external approval email id in the field given and completes the order after receiving the order, the system will send the order approval email to the initial level approver (the first approval in the level approver hierarchy), partial level approver(s), and super approver(s) in this case, the email will be sent to the super approver, the partial approvers and the external approver when partial approver logs in \u2013 they will get a pop up indicating the orders available for approval clicking on the view button will redirect them to the order details page, where a list of all approvers with the order approval status is displayed the partial approver can now accept/reject the order if the order gets rejected, then it gets rejected and no other approver gets the option to approve/reject the order when external approver views the email \u2013 as the external approver does not belong to the system, the mail sent to them contains a link to the order approval page also, in the list of approvers the email id of external approver is mentioned if the order is approved by the super approver, then using the link they\u2019ll just be able to view the order details as shown below \u2013 but, if the order is in pending approval state then they\u2019ll get the provision to approve the order other approvers will now be able to check that the external approval has approved the order scenario 2 (a system with level approvers, super, and partial approver) consider a store with following settings \u2013 four departments (php, sales, marketing, dot net) pay on account \u2013 enabled order approval \u2013 partial order external approval \u2013 optional there are total 7 store customers, out of which there is one super approver (a customer having access to all departments) two partial approvers two level approvers of level 1 and level 2 resp now, when an order is received from a customer belonging to the php department, then all following approvers will receive an email super approver (paul rudd) they\u2019ll also get the edit order and delete buttons along with each product as shown below \u2013 note the delete button will only appear only if there are two or more products in the order partial approval (mathew perry), as the second partial approver doesn\u2019t have the access to php department level 1 approver (harry robin) the customer marta kuffman will receive the order pending for approval email, once the level 1 approver (harry robin) approves the order then, the order approval status will also contain their name\nDid this page help you?\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nStore

product, or do not want any tax to be applied to a product then manage such settings from this section note tax settings configured here will be over written on the flat tax rate for the particular product only tax methodology now, let's learn about how the inclusive and exclusive taxes are calculated for the products in the subtotal tax methodology for tax exclusive pricing tax exclusive pricing is the most intuitive i e easy to understand and use sub total is calculated for all the line items (products) subject to a specific tax code; then, the sub total is multiplied by the appropriate percentage to obtain the tax amount the tax amount is added to the sub total to give the total to apply tax exclusive pricing, go to the admin >> store configuration >> site settings and s earch for the tax/vat amount include in product price set the value as \" default\" and save the setting now, the tax calculation will be exclusive of the product subtotal for example, if the cart subtotal is $38 99 plus the 10% flat tax if the amount of $38 99 is tax exclusive, a 10% tax is added to it , increasing the total to $42 89 the tax shows as an addition when you create an invoice tax methodology for tax inclusive pricing when entering tax inclusive prices, the situation is the opposite in this case, the tax amount is already included in the sub total to apply tax inclusive pricing, you can select any one of the 3 options only default store, only store, or both from the tax/vat amount include in product price setting in this way, the tax calculation will be inclusive of the product subtotal for example, you make the same purchase as in the previous example, using a payment form, but pricing is tax inclusive the resulting total, calculated tax, and presentation change as follows here the tax amount i e 10% of subtotal is already included in subtotal tax rate type global tax this is the flat tax rate set in tax vat settings by default, global tax is applicable on

customer if you use 'post message to customer' in this scenario, it makes your previous quotation void and you will have to enter the quotation again for the customer to approve or reject it\nDid this

bots!! the google recaptcha verifies your website visitors that it is a human and protects your store from bots choosing a type of recaptcha \u2013 there are two types of recaptcha to choose from when creating a new site recaptcha v3 \u2013 recaptcha v3 is transparent for website visitors there are no challenges to solve instead, recaptcha v3 continuously monitors the visitor\u2019s behaviour to determine whether it\u2019s a human or a bot for each request the user makes, recaptcha v3 returns a score between 0 and 1 that represents how likely it is that the request originated from a bot close to 0 sorry, you\u2019re a bot close to 1 congrats, you\u2019re a human recaptcha v2 if a website visitor\u2019s behaviour triggers suspicion, recaptcha v2 will serve a challenge that the visitor must solve to prove they\u2019re human sometimes, all they have to do is check a box that says \u201ci\u2019m not a robot\u201d other times, the recaptcha will challenge you with an image or audio recognition task there are three options available for recaptcha v2 \u2013 i\u2019m not a robot checkbox \u2013 the \"i'm not a robot\" checkbox requires the user to click a checkbox indicating the user is not a robot invisible recaptcha badge \u2013 the invisible recaptcha badge does not require the user to click on a checkbox, instead, it is invoked directly and only the most suspicious traffic will be prompted to solve a captcha recaptcha android \u2013 this validates requests on your android app this will either pass the user through immediately (without a captcha prompt) or challenge them to validate whether they are human purpose we offer both recaptcha v3 and v2 integration services you can integrate any on your print website as per your requirements to keep away the bots how to integrate read the below a systematic guide to integrate google recaptcha on your website 1 register with google recaptcha 1 register with google recaptcha go to the google recaptcha admin

performance website content planning website content planning traffic driving content is available on the website one of the most important influences of website traffic is content if you remove the content from your website then driving new traffic will be a hectic task, thus reducing the overall search traffic do not remove any important content from your website check the seo traffic driving content on your old website using the web analytics tool and in google search console or the webmaster tools inbound links and backlinks inbound links are the links from other websites that point to your website, often referred to as backlinks they are one of the most important elements required for the ranking of any website the relevance of the backlink is passed on from the linked page to the pages this page links to thus, it is important to ensure all the inbound links relevant to the content should be in place as they are useful to the visitors and have a positive impact on the ranking singles optimize the new content as per the previous content if the old website\u2019s content has been optimized then for better search engine rankings it is important to migrate these content optimizations to the new website optimization contains changes to headlines, links from certain words on a page to another page, use of keywords, alt tags, and more you can check your seo history to get a good understanding of the optimized content before making changes to your content or before deleting some elements from the new content right keywords at the right place all the keywords from your previous website should be present in the right places use tools such as google search console and ranking tools to get the keywords information they will inform you about the keywords that are currently driving traffic to your website make sure the new version of these pages is optimized with the same keywords after the relaunch maintain the title tags and meta tags title tags and meta descriptions play a crucial role in the ranking of your website the preview snippets of the search engines are formed using these elements make sure to keep all the title tags and meta descriptions on the new website use resources to strengthen your meta tags and descriptions urls and redirects urls and redirects keep as many of your old urls as possible on your new website try to keep as many as urls from the old website into the new one, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it keep the old urls only change urls if you have to one url per content \u2013 keep no duplicate content when creating a new website, pay keen attention to the url structure of your website duplicate content is produced when the same content is accessed by different urls old url redirection to the new urls every old url that does not exists redirects to a url that is available in the new website structure create a good equivalent of each old url so that every old url could redirect to a new page very similar to the old page if there is no equivalent url set the redirection to the new url that best matches the old content no backlinks point to error pages after your relaunch to preserve your seo performance pay special attention to the urls that have backlinks from other domains compile a full list of all backlinks set up a redirection to a good destination if no url is found for redirection create a new page that satisfies the need for old content use 301 status codes for permanent redirects it is a strong recommendation to use 301 status codes for permanent redirects indexing and crawling of new links indexing and crawling of new links check for robots txt files that could prevent your website content from being crawled and indexed by search engine bots after launching the website make sure no command from the robot txt file prevents your website from being crawled to exclude certain pages from being indexed using \u201cnoindex\u201d meta tags check for missing internal links make sure that the pages driving traffic lose a big number of internal links after the relaunch losing internal links can create a loss in organic traffic as they are an important contributor to overall seo performance other technical look about other technical look about check for canonical implementation as per the old website if your website has canonical tag implementations, then make sure that it is not lost on the new website canonical tags can be useful for signaling to search engines which version of a page should be indexed don\u2019t let your website generate duplicate urls, but sometimes the implementation of canonical tags is feasible pay attention to the 301 redirects to set for canonical and non canonical urls all 301 redirects for urls from your old website should point to canonical urls on your new website check for website xml sitemap as it makes it easier for search engine robots to discover new urls and schedule them for crawling an xml sitemap helps search engine crawlers interpret the structure of a website better this will make it easier for the search engine bots to discover new urls and schedule them for crawling use the xml sitemaps in google search console to monitor how well your website is indexed create xml sitemap and format it correctly such that it contains all pages that you want to be indexed the new website should have a secure connection \u2013 https with https ensure your website visitors know that their data is safe it also has several other seo and web analytics benefits if your website has a domain switch, you might as well switch to https at the same time images\u2019 alt tag migration image alt tags not only help in organic search ranking, but also for the accessibility of your website for users that depend on screen readers they help the users and machines that cannot see the content of images understand the images if you are using image alt tags on your old website, make sure you migrate them to your new website removing alt tags can result in losing image search ranking, as well as \u201cnormal\u201d search ranking for domain switch for domain switch set up and verify the webmaster tools (google / bing / yandex) when you change domains, set up, and verify the webmaster tools this might take a few days until your property shows data and you start monitoring errors and developments after the website relaunch inform the webmasters' tools inform webmasters of a domain switch search engines allow you to inform them about the domain change via webmaster tools this will speed up the process of replacing all urls from the old domain with urls from the new domain in the search engine indexes check for the old ssl certificate after you set up redirects from your old domain to your new domain, the redirects will only work as long as the old domain is still registered under your ownership also, if you had http urls on your old website, you need to have a valid ssl certificate other requirements other requirements create a user friendly error 404 pages the 404 pages should be implemented correctly from a technical perspective relaunching can lead to a bigger number of 404 errors, thus make sure to create a user friendly 404 page for your website from the technical perspective look for the following implementations \u2013 do not redirect faulty urls to a 404 page all 404 pages should return a 404 status code set up a report for tracking 404 errors in google analytics check page load speed metrics for the better user experience and seo success, it is very important to check the page speed top ranking in organic search and page speed metrics go hand in hand, and if do manage your website to rank with slow pages a very few visitors will have the patience to wait until the page loads check the page speed metrics of your website before the relaunch make page speed your top priority nobody accepts an excuse for having a slow website not neglect the mobile version of your new website in the mobile world, it will be foolish if you ignore the mobile versions of your website audit your new website to make sure it is crawlable in the mobile versions of search engine crawlers \u201cmobile first indexing\u201d is yet another reason why you should not neglect mobile crawling before relaunching your new website post launch requirements post launch requirements no pages to be crawled are blocked by robot txt check if the pages you want to crawl are not blocked by the robot txt file check the resources needed for complete rendering of your websites, such as css or js file, make sure they are not blocked by the robot txt file use the crawl error reports to keep track of new errors, to fix them as quickly as possible use the crawl error reports from search engine webmaster tools to keep track of new errors, to fix them as quickly as possible monitor and fix website and server errors error 400, 500, and others are experienced by users and it becomes very much urgent to fix them monitor all the website and server errors caused by users in your web analytics tool monitor the number of organic search landing pages and fix if they are dropping the number of pages that receive organic search traffic is a metric that can help you evaluate the ranking and indexing problems monitor these numbers as a significant change is often caused by internal factors instead of external ones crawl the old urls to make sure the redirection is working correctly after your new website goes live, it is advisable to crawl all the old urls and check if all the redirections are working exactly as they are supposed to be every old url should continue returning a working page with a 200 http status it can also return 301 redirects directly to such a page check for 404 and 5xx errors and redirect chains\nDid this page help you?\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nWebsite Launch Checklist\nNEXT\nSSL Certificate Installation\n\n\n\n----- website-themes.txt
