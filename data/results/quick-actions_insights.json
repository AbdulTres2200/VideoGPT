especially useful for handling similar or recurring requests without having to recreate everything from scratch delete delete delete any quotation with a 2 step confirmation quotes with the status of \u2018quotation approved\u2019 cannot be deleted note it is recommended that you take only one action at a time when some response is pending from the customer so as to avoid any chances of overlapping actions for example, if you have entered your quote amount on the customer's quote, you should not use 'post message to customer' unless your quotation is approved or rejected by the customer if you use 'post message to customer' in this scenario, it makes your previous quotation void and you will have to enter the quotation again for the customer to approve or reject it\nDid this
