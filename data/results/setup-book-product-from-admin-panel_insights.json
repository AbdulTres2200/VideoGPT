as book products such as booklets or brochures, can have no cover page; we have provided an option of no cover and cover included in inner page the latter will be useful when a customer has all the design prepared and is not looking forward to designing the cover page of the book product note these product design options will only be available for the cover page(s) the cover pages are set up in the setup product pages section of designer options price defining method for book product is set to range based with multiplication designer options just like any other product, enter the various

please define the per page price for both b/w and color pages for the number of pages entered at the front store, the system will run a lookup for black and white pages and color pages separately it will \u2013 check the number of b/w pages entered (e g 10) find the price of the pages falling in the range and determine the price (e g 10 x 1 = 10) check the number of color pages entered (e g 5) find the price of the pages falling in the range and determine the price (e g 5 x 2 = 10) perform a summation of both prices and display the result (e g 10 + 10 = 20) additional options in this section, add the additional options associated with your book product examples of such additional options are \u2013 paper type, page coating, binding type, etc unlike the standard product, the book product has one extra additional option feature, where you can assign the additional options to specific book pages like, depending on your product offering you can create additional options for black

type printing side the option will determine the printing has to be done on one side or both the sides of the page and hence the pricing will be applied accordingly there can be only one additional option with the print side option the system will not allow adding more than one option for the printing side if the printing side is selected in the \"type\" section, there will only 2 options radio button and drop down by default once you define the printing side options, do check the double side option for the option name associated with it this will help the system in identifying the double side printing option, helping you in calculating the correct printing price talking about the below image \u2013 when 100 b/w and 100 color pages are added, the price calculation will be only for 50 b/w pages and 50 color pages as the printing side selected is double, i e printing is to be done on both sides of the pages in the second case as printing is to be done on only the single side of the page, thus here the price will be calculated for 100 b/w pages and 100 cover options \u2013 tick this button if the additional option is associated with the cover pages of the book the system will hide this option if the customer chooses to opt for no cover design type attribute prices \u2013 unlike the standard product, for book products, we have kept an open system where you can define separate quantity ranges (from that defined in the product price section) here, you can define any number of ranges for the attribute price which will always be independent of the ones defined in the pricing section so at the time of price calculation system will run a lookup to find the base price of every page from the pricing section, and for each attribute, it will run a separate lookup for the pages in the range defined in additional options price section product settings all the book product settings remain the same as standard products apart from a few they are listed below upload artwork & content pages later option enabling this option will allow your customers to upload the content pages later i e after completing the order front store page lookup this will define how the

the pages entered and later the sum will be multiplied with the book quantity page with copies (page x copies) here for the price calculation system will multiply the page count with the number of book copies (page count x book copies (quantity)) then run a lookup to find the prices falling in the range \u2013 both, book base price and additional options price e g consider number of b/w pages = 5 book quantity = 3 so, the system will first multiple pages with quantities i e 5 x 3 = 15 and then run a price lookup for 15 pages for both book base price and additional options price page with copies (page x copies) (only base price) here for the price calculation system will multiply the page count with the number of book copies (page count x book copies (quantity)) then run a lookup to
