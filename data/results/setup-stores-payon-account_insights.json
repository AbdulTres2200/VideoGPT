considered this simply means the customer has made a payment \u2013 which goes in the accounts receivable ledger \u2013 on the full amount owed for example, you served a store client for their 20 orders in february, and the total price is $5,000 but, instead of paying for each order your client chooses to make the payments \u2018on account\u2019 (using the credit limit given via pay on account from your onprintshop system) at the end of february month once you generate and send the invoice to your store client, then they send you the full payment of $5000 and you\u2019ll note that the
